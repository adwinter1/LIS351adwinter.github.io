<h1>This is the home page of my Lab 2 website. Below you'll find a small paragraph on myself & this page.</h1>

<p>
    I was born December 25, 1998. Being born on Christmas sure was fun, especially since my last name is Winter. Had
    my go-to icebreaker figured out since day 1. Isn't this font nice? It's called 'Garamond'. Sounded fancy.
    I made this extra big for readability as well. Hopefully it's supported by your browser. Also threw some margins
    in too, really brings the whole thing together. Thank you for reading my paragraph</p>
